            <h2 style='width:90%; margin: auto;'>tl;dr:</h2>
            <p style='width:90%; margin: auto;'>If you're interested in eating fresh local lettuce, microgreens, and herbs—and supporting Plant Lab as part of our neighborhood food system—our greens share is for you! Email us at info@hollandplantlab.com to sign up.</p>
            <button class="accordion">What is a greens share?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>A greens share (or, as we like to call it, Garden Candy) will generally contain 3 items: two different microgreens and one leaf lettuce.  We'll occasionally include herbs or other extras as we experiment with new things.</p>
                <p>Our food is packaged in compostable plastic containers.  These will however require commercial composting (they don't degrade very fast in your backyard pile).  If you don't have access to a commercial composting service we'll take them back for free and make sure they get composted.</p>
                <p>Pickup - Weekly on Wednesday from 4-6</p>
                <p>If this doesn't work for you please ask about alternate pickup times.  Delivery ]delivery-copy]</p>
                <p>Cost - $168 for 3 months (billed monthly)</p>
                <p>If you are interested in a share but the pricing is a challenge for your budget please let us know.  At Plant Lab we are more committed to food access than profit and want to operate on a pay what you can model.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Why is Plant Lab doing a CSA?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Community Supported Agriculture is a way for people to partner with local farms on a regular basis.  It gives the customer a predictable source of local food and gives the farm a more predictable source of revenue.</p>
              <p>Growing greens in a controlled environment requires careful planning and relatively expensive inputs.  Selling greens is frankly even harder.  They don’t last very long after harvest so shortening the time between harvest and purchase is critical.  It’s also really hard to grow efficiently for unknown levels of sales.  Conventional farms and food distribution channels compensate for this by dramatically overproducing to ensure they can capture enough sales to make money.  This results in a huge amount of food waste, by many estimates more that half of greens grown in the US get wasted.  By having members commit to a CSA share we are able to plan very accurately for how much to grow each week.  Our goal is to operate at near-zero food waste.</p>
