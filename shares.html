                  <summary>what is a greens share? </summary>
                  <p>A greens share (or, as we like to call it, Garden Candy) will generally contain 3 items: two different microgreens and one leaf-lettuce.  We'll occasionally include herbs or other extras as we experiment with new things.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Pickup: weekly on Wednesday from 12-6pm</h3>
                  <p>If this doesn't work for you please ask about alternate pickup times! There is also a possbility of delivery; we'll set a fair price based on location.</p>
                  <h3>Cost: $168 for 3 months</h3>
                  <p>If you are interested in a share but the pricing is a challenge for your budget please let us know.  At Plant Lab we are more committed to food access than profit and want to operate on a pay-what-you-can model.</p>

                  <aside>Our shares come in compostable plastic containers.  These will however require commercial composting (they don't degrade very fast in your backyard pile).  If you don't have access to a commercial composting service we'll take them back for free and make sure they get composted.</aside>

                  <summary>why are we doing a CSA?</summary>
                  <p>Community Supported Agriculture is a way for people to partner with local farms on a regular basis.  It gives the customer a dependable source of local food and gives the farm a more predictable source of revenue.</p>
                  <p>Growing greens in a controlled environment requires careful planning and relatively expensive inputs.  *Selling* greens is frankly even trickier.  For the sake of freshness, shortening the time between harvest and purchase is critical.  It's also really hard to grow efficiently for unknown levels of sales.  Conventional farms and food distribution channels compensate for this by dramatically overproducing to ensure they can capture enough sales to make money.  This results in a huge amount of food wasteâ€”by many estimates more that half of greens grown in the US get wasted.  By having members commit to a CSA share we are able to plan very accurately for how much to grow each week.  Our goal is to operate at near-zero food waste.</p>

                  <summary>how does one sign up?</summary>
                  <p>To sign up simply email us and let us know what date you'd like to start receiving a share and if you need pickup, delivery, or pricing accommodations. Email us at <span class="no-hyphen">in<!-- abc@def -->fo@hollandplantl<!-- @abc.com -->ab.com</span>.</p>
                  <p>If you'd like to talk about the share in person just let us know or stop by on a Wednesday between 4-6 and we'll *usually* be at the Lab.</p>
