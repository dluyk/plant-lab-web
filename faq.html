                  <summary>who runs Plant Lab?</summary>
                  <p>Plant Lab was started and is run by Leah and Daniel, residents of the neighborhood where the Lab is located.</p>
                  <p>Leah is the Farm Director and manages the growing operation and most of the other work required to run the Lab.</p>
                  <p>Daniel helps with the growing and is responsible for the “engineering” and doing the minimum amount of businessy stuff required to keep things legal and the grow-lights on.</p>

                  <summary>what do you grow?</summary>
                  <p>We grow a variety of greens.  We are always experimenting with new things and will expand what we grow over time.</p>
                  <h3>microgreens</h3>
                  <p>Arugula, Chineses cabbage, Amaranth, Pea shoots, Radish, Broccoli, Sunflower shoots, Kale, Amaranth </p>
                  <h3>lettuce</h3>
                  <p>Grand Rapids leaf lettuce, Wildfire mix, Encore Mix</p>

                    <summary>whose land are you on? </summary>
                    <p>We have the deed and title from Ottawa County, however… </p>
                    <p>We acknowledge that Plant Lab occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi peoples. In particular Plant Lab resides on Land ceded in the August 29, 1821 Cession Treaty 117 between said Indigenous Peoples and the US government.  We recognize, support, and advocate for the sovereignty of Michigan’s twelve federally-recognized Indian nations, for historic Indigenous communities in Michigan, for Indigenous individuals and communities who live here now, and for those who were forcibly removed from their Homelands.</p>

                  <summary>why do you grow indoors?</summary>
                  <p>We are based in Holland which is in Hardiness Zone 6b, this means growing greens outside much of the year is simply not possible.  Growing indoors in a controlled environment allows us to grow year-round.   By growing greens locally even in winter we hope to reduce the amount of produce that needs to be shipped long distances into our community.</p> 
                  <p>Growing indoors allows us to create and follow a highly repeatable process, think of it a blend of farming and manufacturing.  This standardization drives efficient use of resources like water, soil, nutrients, etc.  We are working to grow great food with low resource inputs.  Also, by vertically stacking our growing systems we can grow more food in less space than conventional agriculture.</p>

                    <summary>is the food clean and safe?</summary>
                    <p>All food, especially when it isn’t cooked, comes with risk, ours is no exception.  However by carefully controlling the growing environment we produce the cleanest food possible.  We have a documented food safety plan and follow it closely.  If you are interested in learning more about our food safety practice we are happy to share.</p>

                    <summary>do you use any chemical to treat the plants?</summary>
                    <p>Growing in a controlled environment allows us to carefully control all aspects of the growing system which means we don’t use any fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, or other chemicals. We use nutrient additives for our hydroponics growing and hydrogen peroxide for disinfection.</p>

                    <summary>how do you package the greens? </summary>
                    <p>Our packing is fully compostable but it does require a commercial composting operation, it may not degrade quickly in your backyard pile.  If you don’t have access to a commercial composting service we will take our packages back for free and make sure they get composted.  We hope to move towards fully reusable packaging in the future.</p>

                    <summary>how do I buy greens? </summary>
                    <p>The primary way to buy our food is through our CSA Shares, you can find the details <a href="shares.html">here</a>.</p> 
                    <p>We also offer a limited selection for sale for walk-ins during our open hours on Wednesday from 12-6.  Availability will be based on many factors, we aren’t a grocery store.</p> 
                    <p>We do offer larger quantities for sale to restaurants and other organizations who want to purchase in bulk.  Please contact us for more info.</p>

                    <summary>can I come see the growing operation?</summary>
                    <p>Sure you can, but only on our terms.  In an effort to keep our growing and processing rooms clean we control access beyond the front room at the lab.  That being said, we love to share what we do and how we do it so if you’d like to learn more, stop by during open hours or schedule a time to come check it out by emailing us, just know that not anytime is a good time for a tour. </p>

                    <summary>what can I do if I can’t afford the prices at Plant Lab?</summary>
                    <p>No worries, the reality is that lots of people can’t afford our prices.  The other reality is that producing food has real costs that have to be covered.  That being said, we are more committed to food access than profits.   We strive to operate on a pay-what-you-can model, so if our prices don’t work for your budget just ask for a discount.  We know this is far from a perfect solution, having to ask for a discount is a huge barrier all on its own. We are actively working to get better at this and are open to feedback on how to do it better.  </p>

                    <summary>is Plant Lab a for profit business?</summary>
                    <p>Yes… Well, kind of, it’s a little complicated.  Legally we are a privately owned for-profit business.  Farming as a business is complicated and often not profitable without various revenue streams including government subsidies for larger growers, which we are not eligible for.  Our primary goal is to grow good food sustainably for our community to help make our local food system better for the environment and better for people.  We are actively trying to figure out new ways of measuring success in addition to profits, we’ll hopefully share more about this in the future.  We also hope to run profitably to provide for our family and to be able to invest in new experiments.  It will take the support of a large group of people to make this a reality.</p>

                    <summary>so I’ve heard that you have a Zine… what is that?</summary>
                    <p>We do have a Zine, it is one of the many awesome benefits that come with being a CSA member.  We write about the plants we grow and other random stuff.  Our Line Achieve can be found here.</p>
