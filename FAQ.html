                        <summary>What are microgreens?</summary>
                        <p>For those who haven't eaten a lot of Microgreens before… They are basically just tiny greens harvested very early.  They pack a ton of flavor and are incredibly nutrient-dense.  They look “fancy” but really are very easy to eat.  They don't need to be cooked and can be added to almost anything as a simple way to add flavor and boost the national value of a meal without any peeling, slicing, dicing, or cooking.</p>

                        <p>No. But...</p>
                        <p>Growing in a controlled environment allows us to carefully control all aspects of the growing system which means we don't use any herbicides, pesticides, or other harsh chemicals. We use nutrient additives for our hydroponics growing and food-contact-safe hydrogen peroxide for disinfection.</p>

                        <p>Our packing is fully compostable but it does require a commercial composting operation, it may not degrade quickly in your backyard pile.  If you don't have access to a commercial composting service we will take our packages back for free and make sure they get composted.  We hope to move towards fully reusable packaging in the future.</p>

                        <summary>Why do CSA?</summary>
                        <p><strong>C</strong>ommunity <strong>S</strong>upported <strong>A</strong>griculture is a way for people to partner with local farms on a regular basis. It gives the customer a dependable source of local food and gives the farm a more predictable source of revenue.</p>
                        <p>Growing produce in a controlled environment requires careful planning and relatively expensive inputs. *Selling* greens is frankly even trickier. For the sake of freshness, shortening the time between harvest and purchase is critical. It's also really hard to grow efficiently for unknown levels of sales. Conventional farms and food distribution channels compensate for this by dramatically overproducing to ensure they can capture enough sales to make money. This results in a huge amount of food waste—by many estimates more that half of greens grown in the US get wasted. By having members commit to a CSA share we are able to plan very accurately for how much to grow each week. Our goal is to operate at near-zero food waste.</p>

                        <summary>What if I can't afford your prices?</summary>
                        <p>No worries, the reality is that lots of people can't afford our prices.  The other reality is that producing food has real costs that have to be covered.  That being said, we are more committed to food access than profits.   We strive to operate on a pay-what-you-can model, so if our prices don't work for your budget just ask for a discount.  We know this is far from a perfect solution, having to ask for a discount is a huge barrier all on its own. We are actively working to get better at this and are open to feedback on how to do it better.</p>

                        <summary>Is Plant Lab a for profit business?</summary>
                        <p>Yes… Well, kind of, it's a little complicated.  Legally we are a privately owned for-profit business.  Farming as a business is complicated and often not profitable without various revenue streams including government subsidies for larger growers, which we are not eligible for.  Our primary goal is to grow good food sustainably for our community to help make our local food system better for the environment and better for people.  We are actively trying to figure out new ways of measuring success in addition to profits, we'll hopefully share more about this in the future.  We also hope to run profitably to provide for our family and to be able to invest in new experiments.  It will take the support of a large group of people to make this a reality.</p>

                        <p>208 W. 18th St. Holland, Michigan</p>
                        <p>Plant Lab occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi peoples. In particular Plant Lab resides on Land ceded in the August 29, 1821 Cession Treaty 117 between said Indigenous Peoples and the US government.  We recognize, support, and advocate for the sovereignty of Michigan's twelve federally-recognized Indian nations, for historic Indigenous communities in Michigan, for Indigenous individuals and communities who live here now, and for those who were forcibly removed from their Homelands.</p>

                        <summary>Why grow indoors?</summary>
                        <p>We are based in Holland which is in Hardiness Zone 6b, this means growing greens outside much of the year is simply not possible.  Growing indoors in a controlled environment allows us to grow year-round.   By growing greens locally even in winter we hope to reduce the amount of produce that needs to be shipped long distances into our community.</p> 
                        <p>Growing indoors allows us to create and follow a highly repeatable process, think of it a blend of farming and manufacturing.  This standardization drives efficient use of resources like water, soil, nutrients, etc.  We are working to grow great food with low resource inputs.  Also, by vertically stacking our growing systems we can grow more food in less space than conventional agriculture.</p>

                        <summary>How do you address food safety?</summary>
                        <p>All food, especially when it isn't cooked, comes with risk, ours is no exception.  However by carefully controlling the growing environment we produce the cleanest food possible.  We have a documented food safety plan and follow it closely.  If you are interested in learning more about our food safety practice we are happy to share.</p>
